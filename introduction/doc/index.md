# Vue 3 Starter

This is a simple Vue.js-based Design System starter that you can build from to build your own Design System.

## Design tokens

This starter contains some design token examples implemented in [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) with SCSS.
You can head to any of them (for example [colors](../../colors/doc/colors.md)) and see the tokens being show cased in the documentation.

## Documentation

The documentation of this starter is written with a [Vue flavored markdown](https://backlight.dev/docs/md-vue), so that even writing documentation feels closers to actually developing in Vue.

It uses a combination of [dockit-vue](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-vue) and [dockit-core](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-core).

The former provides a [Vue layout](https://studio.backlight.dev/doc/JwppqaVhCm2NyL9qmkDM/layout/doc/layout.md) and some interesting documentation components like [Props](https://studio.backlight.dev/doc/JwppqaVhCm2NyL9qmkDM/props/doc/props.md).

The latter contains [web components](https://studio.backlight.dev/doc/4BeMe20hqOWTkdUL2NuJ/introduction/doc/introduction.md) used in this starter kit to showcase CSS properties.

## Writing components

Two very simple components are provided as examples for you to build on.
The [Button](../../button/doc/button.md) component has some documentation, some stories and tests.

Stories are written using [Storybook's Component Story Format(CSF)](https://backlight.dev/docs/component-story-format).

The documentation leverages Vue markdown capabilities to include visual examples and code blocks for references.

## Usage in your application

We have documentation on using a Backlight Design System in your application. It comes in different flavor depending on your use case:

- [generic procedure](https://backlight.dev/docs/using-ds)
- [with Nuxt 3](https://backlight.dev/docs/using-ds-on-nuxt3) - you can see an example using this starter [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-hy7suy?file=app.vue)
